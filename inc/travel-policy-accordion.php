        <p>BUS TRAVEL: This Lamers Connect route operates seven days a week, 365 days a year. Arrive at your pickup location 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Please travel with photo ID. Advance ticket purchases are welcome. Seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. During peak travel periods, Lamers will (to the best of its ability) operate additional buses/schedules to increase capacity and accommodate passenger demand. Schedules, locations, and fares are subject to change.

BUS TICKETS: Most bus stops sell tickets during business hours, and many passengers purchase their tickets the same day they travel. Bus stops are managed independently and have varying policies for hours, forms of payment, and parking. If boarding from a stop that is closed or does not sell tickets, you can board the bus with payment in hand, and simply purchase your ticket at the next available stop. If no ticket counter is available before your destination stop, then Lamers Connect drivers will accept cash payment: exact change only.

CUSTOMERS WITH DISABILITIES: Please contact Lamers Bus Lines at 1-800-261-6600 as far in advance as possible to request assistance. Lamers will be better able to help you during your trip if we know in advance that you are coming and what your needs are. Lamers Bus Lines is available to provide any requested assistance which is reasonable and safe. Common requests include assistance with boarding and de-boarding, luggage, transfers, and stowage and retrieval of wheeled mobility devices. This service is provided during transfers, rest stops and other times as reasonably requested.

If the passenger does not speak English, we encourage you to call for assistance in advance, to help our driver(s) better assist the passenger with boarding and de-boarding at the correct stop locations on their travel date.

Keys to a successful trip: Arrive at least 30 minutes before scheduled departure time. Please travel with photo ID. Notify the ticket agent or employee at your boarding location of your need for assistance, and inform Lamers drivers/employees of your needs during your trip.

You may travel alone on Lamers only if you are able to travel independently and do not require assistance of a personal nature such as help using the restroom, dispensing medication or constant care during travel. Lamers is not required to provide this type of assistance. If you require assistance that we cannot provide, you may wish to include a personal care attendant (PCA) in your travel plans.

No dogs, cats, birds, or other animals will be transported. However, a service dog, trained for the purpose of accompanying a disabled person, will be permitted to travel with the disabled person at no additional charge.

ONLINE TICKETS: Printable online tickets are available – only if the passenger starts and ends on Lamers Connect routes exclusively, and they can print their ticket. Ticket counters do NOT have the ability to print bus tickets that were purchased from GoLamers.com, and the passenger cannot board without a printed hard copy to hand the driver. If you cannot print your ticket, then you must purchase your ticket another way.
